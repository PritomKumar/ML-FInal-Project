## About The Research

Handwritten letter recognition in any language is always a problematic and time-consuming task. Depending on the number of letters we may have more than one thousand classes. For the Bengali language, it is even more difficult because it is highly stylized, morphologically complex, and comprises potentially juxtapositional letters. Even though it has more than 230 million users worldwide and is the fifth most spoken language in the world, the
improvements over the years in Bengali letter recognition are significantly less as compared to the other languages. In this paper, we investigate the performance of recognization of Bengali handwritten letters using some deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models. We use the state-of-the-art pre-trained neural network models to learn about some special characteristics of the letters and use densely connected layers for the discrimination task. We trained our system on the CMATERdb dataset and test on the Ekush dataset. By using two different datasets for the training and testing purpose we can be more confident that our network is more robust and handles more variation. It achieves 97.74% accuracy
on the validation dataset and 87.85% accuracy on the test dataset.

## Methodology

There are four steps to our work.

1. Collect the dataset for training and testing.
2. Preprocess the dataset and perform data augmentation.
3. Train the dataset on the D-CNN models and their variants.
4. Test the models on a completely different dataset. and analyze the results
